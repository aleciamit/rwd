    <p>Hello! I am a visual graphic designer and photographer living in Wilmington NC.</p>

    <p>I am a creative, detail-oriented graphic artist with several years experience specializing in digital and print
        media. Highly artistic and curious, I’m always looking for emerging concepts and trends by analyzing how things
        move, connect and flow. When starting a new project, I try to understand the “why” of what we are trying to do
        and “what” is the thing we are trying to solve.</p>

    <p>Design is important to me because art is a visual, sensory experience, and can convey thoughtful emotions when
        words fail us.</p>
